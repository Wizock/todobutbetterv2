I appologise for the stagnent nature of this project, more progress is promised during the following month. 

## Welcome to todobutbetter version 2.0

the previous version had been constructed using

```
Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Postgres
```

however, html and css is somthing that if hand written, is considered primative. It is my opinion that SSR applications are under-developed
